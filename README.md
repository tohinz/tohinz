### Hi there 👋

I'm Tobias, a Research Engineer at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) and a PhD student at the University of Hamburg, Germany.

I work with Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and am interested in anything that is related to generative models (mostly in computer vision), implicit models, and neural rendering.

For more info check out my [website](https://www.tobiashinz.com/).
